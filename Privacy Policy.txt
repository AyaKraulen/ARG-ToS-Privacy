Data Collection and Storage

ARG does not collect or store data automatically upon being added to a guild. Data collection begins only when specific commands or configurations are initiated by a guild moderator. The following data may be stored:

    Moderation Module:
        Channel IDs, member IDs, role IDs, and guild IDs are stored when moderators use commands like warn, mute, or configure settings.
        Member IDs are stored when a member is warned or blacklisted.
        Data related to a member is automatically removed when they leave the guild.
        Moderators can manually remove stored configurations using the appropriate commands. Run the config help command for details on managing configurations.

    Tags Module:
        When a tag is created, ARG stores the tag name, content, and guild ID.
        Tags can be deleted using the deletetag command.

    Starboard Module:
        When the starboard module is enabled, ARG stores the channel ID designated for the starboard.

    Server Utility Commands:
        When server utility commands (e.g., locking emojis) are used, ARG stores the relevant emoji IDs.

No data is collected or stored unless explicitly configured by a guild moderator.
Data Privacy

All data collected by ARG is used solely for the bot’s functionality and is accessible only to the bot’s developer. Data is not shared with any third parties.
Data Removal

    Member-specific data is automatically deleted when a member leaves the guild.
